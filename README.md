## NextJS /w Redux boilerplate
Hello world! NextJS v10.0 was released a few days before these lines were written, and I figured out its time I'll have a fresh boilerplate ready for my future projects. Feel free to use it aswell!

## What this project includes?
 * This project was generated using create-next-app, and uses:
- React v17.0.1 /w Redux & Redux-Thunk
- MVC approach pages
- Basic folder structure that would fit most projects, at least initially.
- A nice template of global HOCs
- ESlint configured using abnb's styleguide with some minor customizations by myself

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute and add improvments to this project, there's always a nicer & better way of doing things :D

## Notes & Credits
This boiler is based on Shahaf Antwarg's work, go star his stuff at:
